- Goal: Create a calculator that that input numbers and methods (addiion, subtraction, multiplication,
division) in order to output the result
- Conditions: Do NOT use eval(), nor return "new Function()" which evaluates a string (I'm not fully sure why; Those methods will apparently do the work for you, without you understanding the fundamental principles related to the project.)
- Context: n/a

Steps:
- Create interface
- Create functions to do the actual math
- Link interface buttons to function input
- Output results to a user-visible display field (input will also display here)

Interface:
- Blank page is fine, create a rectangle where hight == 2x width. (Scale with browser? Or stay small?)
- Divide interfact into subsections
    - Results on top (display)
    - Delete/Add/Subtract/Multiply/Divide on the far right going down (methods)
    - (, ), and Clear below the display panel and above the number panel (utilities) /*( and ) won't be implemented, so color them red or don't include them yet*/
    - Numbers 1-9 on left-hand center, right-to-left and top-down in descending order underneath the utility panel (numbers)
    - Period, 0, and = at the bottom of the number panel (Enter probably shouldn't have been part of the numbers panel, but it works out evenly this way)
ex:
|-------------|
| display     |
|-------------|
|( |) | C | โซ |
|7 |8 | 9 | + |
|4 |5 | 6 | - |
|1 |2 | 3 | * |
|. |0 | = | รท |
|-------------|


Functions:
- Placeholder variables, two for numbers (num1/num2) and one for operator (op).
- Include adding numbers to num1/num2 in event listener (if op exists, then num2)
- = button calculates results, then updates displayValue, then resets num1/op/num2.
- Use four switches, one for each operator (+, -, *, รท), to calculate.
- Clear button clears display and resets num1/op/num2 values.
