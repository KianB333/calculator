- Goal: Create a calculator that that input numbers and methods (addiion, subtraction, multiplication,
division) in order to output the result
- Conditions: Do NOT use eval(), nor return "new Function()" which evaluates a string (I'm not fully sure why; Those methods will apparently do the work for you, without you understanding the fundamental principles related to the project.)
- Context: n/a

Steps:
- Create interface
- Link interface to javascript.js
- Create functions to do the actual math
- Output results to a user-visible field (input will also display here)

Interface:
- Blank page is fine, create a rectangle where hight == 2x width. (Scale with browser? Or stay small?)
- Divide interfact into subsections
    - User screen on top, Delete key to the right (results panel)
    - Add/Subtract/Multiply/Divide on the far right going down (methods panel)
    - Numbers 1-9 on the left, left to right and top-down (number panel)
    - 0, period, and Enter at the bottom of the number panel (Enter probably should have been part of the methods panel, but it works out evenly this way)
ex:
|-------------|
|texthere |DEL|
|-------------|
|1 |2 | 3 | + |
|4 |5 | 6 | - |
|7 |8 | 9 | * |
|0 |. | = | รท |
